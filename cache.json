          "description": "April 2022\nOne of the most surprising things I've witnessed in my lifetime is\nthe rebirth of the concept of heresy.\nIn his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the\nmoment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:\n\n  Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly\n  to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three\n  unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.\n  [1]\n\nThe first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly\nmedieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when\nI reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description of\ncontemporary employment.\nThere are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired\nfor.

Putting ideas\ninto words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually\nwrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over  to\nget them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but\nincomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones\nyou thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write\nthem.\nOnce you publish something, the convention is that whatever you\nwrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your\nideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true.\nYou know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not\njust the ideas you published.
