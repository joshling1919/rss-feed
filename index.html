A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son
told me he couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to write more of the story he
was working on. This made me as happy as anything I&#x27;ve heard him
say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because
he&#x27;d discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your
own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.
It&#x27;s more fun, but also much more productive.
What proportion of great work has been done by people who were
skating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.
There is something special about working on a project of your own.
I wouldn&#x27;t say exactly that you&#x27;re happier. A better word would be
excited, or engaged. You&#x27;re happy when things are going well, but
often they aren&#x27;t. When I…</span>

When people say that in their experience all programming languages
are basically equivalent, they&#x27;re making a statement not about
languages but about the kind of programming they&#x27;ve done.
99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library
functions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one
can easily spend one&#x27;s whole career operating in the intersection
of popular programming languages.
But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.
If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird
languages is a good clue to follow.
Weird languages aren&#x27;t weird by accident. Not the good ones, at
least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence
of some form of programming that&#x27;s not just the usual gluing togeth…</span>

It might not seem there&#x27;s much to learn about how to work hard.
Anyone who&#x27;s been to school knows what it entails, even if they
chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And
yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I
was in school, the answer is definitely yes.
One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you&#x27;ll
have to work very hard. I wasn&#x27;t sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork
varied in difficulty; one didn&#x27;t always have to work super hard to
do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to
do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard
work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.
There isn&#x27;t.
The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low

If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say
that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a
more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.
Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But
that wasn&#x27;t what was special about Einstein. What was special about
him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a
necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not
identical.
It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence
and its consequences are not identical, but it isn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a big
gap between them. Anyone who&#x27;s spent time around universities and
research labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart
people who don&#x27;t achieve very much.

(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)
When I was a kid, I&#x27;d have said there wasn&#x27;t. My father told me so.
Some people like some things, and other people like other things,
and who&#x27;s to say who&#x27;s right?
It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste
that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father
was wrong. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to give you here: a proof by
reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there&#x27;s no
such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are
obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.
We&#x27;d better start by saying what good taste is. There&#x27;s a narrow
sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one
in which it refers to preferences of any kin…</span>
