Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows
you that you didn&#x27;t know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas
into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually
wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over  to
get them exactly right. And your ideas won&#x27;t just be imprecise, but
incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones
you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that&#x27;s why I write
them.
Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you
wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your
ideas, and now you&#x27;ve expressed them. But you know this isn&#x27;t true.
You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not
just the ideas you published. Presumably there were oth…</span>

If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say
that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a
more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.
Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But
that wasn&#x27;t what was special about Einstein. What was special about
him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a
necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not
identical.
It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence
and its consequences are not identical, but it isn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a big
gap between them. Anyone who&#x27;s spent time around universities and
research labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart
people who don&#x27;t achieve very much.

(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)
When I was a kid, I&#x27;d have said there wasn&#x27;t. My father told me so.
Some people like some things, and other people like other things,
and who&#x27;s to say who&#x27;s right?
It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste
that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father
was wrong. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to give you here: a proof by
reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there&#x27;s no
such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are
obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.
We&#x27;d better start by saying what good taste is. There&#x27;s a narrow
sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one
in which it refers to preferences of any kin…</span>

When people say that in their experience all programming languages
are basically equivalent, they&#x27;re making a statement not about
languages but about the kind of programming they&#x27;ve done.
99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library
functions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one
can easily spend one&#x27;s whole career operating in the intersection
of popular programming languages.
But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.
If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird
languages is a good clue to follow.
Weird languages aren&#x27;t weird by accident. Not the good ones, at
least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence
of some form of programming that&#x27;s not just the usual gluing togeth…</span>
